Benchmark testing

What do we need to test?
1. Test enqueing of tasks and stake claim of tasks in parallel
2. Test 1 + Test claim renewal 
3. Test 1 + Test task stake and marking as complete

Benchmark test:

Enqueue 20 tasks in parallel by two go routines, with different priorities
Claim by 4 go routine workers in parallel, marking the tasks as complete as soon they receive them
